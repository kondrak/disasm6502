## Operating System (VM environment) ##

# Rust needs at least Visual Studio 2013 Appveyor OS for MSVC targets.
os: Visual Studio 2015

## Build Matrix ##

# This configuration will setup a build for each channel & target combination (12 windows
# combinations in all).
#
# There are 3 channels: stable, beta, and nightly.
#
# The values for target are the set of windows Rust build targets. Each value is of the form
#
# ARCH-pc-windows-TOOLCHAIN
#
# Where ARCH is the target architecture, either x86_64 or i686, and TOOLCHAIN is the linker
# toolchain to use, either msvc or gnu. See https://www.rust-lang.org/downloads.html#win-foot for
# a description of the toolchain differences.
#
# Comment out channel/target combos you do not wish to build in CI.

### MSVC Toolchains ###

  # Stable 64-bit MSVC
    - channel: stable
      target: x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
  # Stable 32-bit MSVC
    - channel: stable
      target: i686-pc-windows-msvc
  # Beta 64-bit MSVC
    - channel: beta
      target: x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
  # Beta 32-bit MSVC
    - channel: beta
      target: i686-pc-windows-msvc
  # Nightly 64-bit MSVC
    - channel: nightly
      target: x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
  # Nightly 32-bit MSVC
    - channel: nightly
      target: i686-pc-windows-msvc

### GNU Toolchains ###

  # Stable 64-bit GNU
    - channel: stable
      target: x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
  # Stable 32-bit GNU
    - channel: stable
      target: i686-pc-windows-gnu
  # Beta 64-bit GNU
    - channel: beta
      target: x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
  # Beta 32-bit GNU
    - channel: beta
      target: i686-pc-windows-gnu
  # Nightly 64-bit GNU
    - channel: nightly
      target: x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
  # Nightly 32-bit GNU
    - channel: nightly
      target: i686-pc-windows-gnu

### Allowed failures ###

# See Appveyor documentation for specific details. In short, place any channel or targets you wish
# to allow build failures on (usually nightly at least is a wise choice). This will prevent a build
# or test failure in the matching channels/targets from failing the entire build.
matrix:
  allow_failures:
    - channel: nightly

# If you only care about stable channel build failures, uncomment the following line:
    #- channel: beta

# 32-bit MSVC isn't stablized yet, so you may optionally allow failures there (uncomment line):
    #- target: i686-pc-windows-msvc

## Install Script ##

# This is the most important part of the Appveyor configuration. This installs the version of Rust
# specified by the 'channel' and 'target' environment variables from the build matrix. This uses
# rustup to install Rust.
#
# For simple configurations, instead of using the build matrix, you can simply set the
# default-toolchain and default-host manually here.
install:
- appveyor DownloadFile https://win.rustup.rs/ -FileName rustup-init.exe
- rustup-init -yv --default-toolchain %channel% --default-host %target%
- set PATH=%PATH%;%USERPROFILE%\.cargo\bin
- rustc -vV
- cargo -vV

## Build Script ##

# Uses 'cargo build' to build. Alternatively, the project may call rustc directly or perform other
# build commands. Rust will automatically be placed in the PATH environment variable.
build_script:
- cmd: cargo build --verbose

## Build Script ##

# Uses 'cargo test' to run tests. Alternatively, the project may call compiled programs directly or
# perform other testing commands. Rust will automatically be placed in the PATH environment
# variable.
test_script:
- cmd: cargo test --verbose
